## Description

In this project I created a web Development quiz that gives you 30 seconds to answer a various amount of questions. these questions will always be randomized and will not be repeated. Your score will be recorded and a prompt will ask for your name to store both name and score into local storage for retrieving even after page is reloaded.

-In this project we tons of javascript functions for quiz logic including dynamic questions, answers, and timer. I've learned about local storage and how to use this data to display on webpage.
